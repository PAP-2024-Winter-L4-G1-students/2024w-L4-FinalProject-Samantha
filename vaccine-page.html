        <h2>How Do Vaccines Work?</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>mRNA vaccines such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines work by teaching the cells in the body how to make a protien that triggers an immune response. This is done by administering a weakened pathogen into the body and an immunse system response is acvivated. Your cells make the S protien that is found on the COVID-29 virus. </li>
                <li>Protien subunit vaccines such as the Novavax vaccine work by including only the parts of a virus that best stimulate your immune system. S protiens are included which causes your immunse system to build antibodies. </li>
                <li>Both vaccines make it easier on your immune system to attack and get rid of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. When your immune system comes into contact with this pathogen again, it will be better equipped.</li>
                </ul>
